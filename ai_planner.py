        CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
        1. This is a DAILY PLAN - schedule ALL activities on the SAME DAY ({selected_date.strftime('%A, %B %d')})
        2. Do NOT spread activities across multiple days
        3. Assign specific times to each activity based on weather conditions
        4. Consider these factors:
           - Avoid outdoor activities during extreme heat (>30°C) or heavy rain (>5mm)
           - Prefer moderate temperatures (18-25°C) for physical activities
           - Consider wind speed for cycling or outdoor events
           - Utilize solar radiation for photography or solar-related activities
           - Plan indoor activities during poor weather conditions
        5. If an activity already has a time specified, try to honor it if weather permits
        6. Provide detailed weather information for each time slot

           - Prefer moderate temperatures (18-25°C) for physical activities

           - If an activity requires leaving home NEVER assign it to days with temperature >30°C or precipitation >3mm.
           - If an activity is clearly indoors , you can assign it on any day.
           - Always prefer days with moderate weather for outdoor tasks.
